To run our solution there are some setup steps that need to be done:

    1. Use Python version 3.9.16 or greater to avoid dependency problems. 
    2. HDFS must be running with the folders /user/bdm/ created.
    3. HBase must be running.
    4. Ensure that run.sh has execution permissions.
    5. Ensure that the tree of the project has the following format:
        .
        ├── data
        │   ├── idealista
        │   ├── lookup_tables
        │   └── opendatabcn-income
        ├── instructions.txt
        ├── logs
        └── scripts
            ├── dataCollectors.py
            ├── hdfsToHBase.py
            ├── requirements.txt
            └── run.sh


All calls to python scripts or installation of libraries can be done
through the run.sh file. In case of error, you may need to change the
python command to python3
